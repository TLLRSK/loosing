                    <h2>Who</h2>
                    <p>Ibizan artist Giuseppe Pepe has launched a campaign called Loosing My Mind, a series of picture perfect photo manipulations in which he has taken the heavy editing process to its logical conclusion: removing the face entirely. He calls the eerie effect of faceless bodies in Instagram-optimizied scenarios as 'anti-beauty.'</p>

                    <h2>What and why</h2>
                    <p>In an era where everything is fake, where everything is designed to appear, even a simple photo has lost its spirit due to the editing. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit duis vitae metus, nisl pulvinar erat nullam lacinia iaculis semper bibendum cum, ligula eget ante ac vulputate sollicitudin. I decided to create a project that did reflect, or where the secondary part of the picture becomes the main part. Rather than use my own pictures, I wanted to make the concept global.</p>

                    <h2>The team</h2>
                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur metus, nisl pulvinar erat nullam lacinia iaculis semper bibendum cum, ligula eget ante ac vulputate sollicitudin suspendisse pellentesque commodo. How would we look without our heads, without our body engine? This image may look funny, scary, uniqueâ€¦ I thought, why not 'decapitate' our heads off to see what it looks like?</p>
